This tag has been around for a couple of years but the original is private so I can't link to it! I found it on the channel of the dazzling [Ariel Bissett](https://youtu.be/A700s47V0hQ).

Accidentally missed answering #7 (reading at home or everywhere) but to be honest it's not very relevant at the moment.
