Rat queen yells at you about the order in which those paper sandwiches are arranged on the tree plates. The title of this video is from a radio series called [Divesting From People Pleasing](https://www.theheartradio.org/divesting-from-people-pleasing) by [The Heart](https://www.theheartradio.org/) (which used to be my favourite podcast but I've aggressively disliked it since new people have taken over); the concept of recognising a pattern in yourself which is historically alluring and normalised but ultimately destructive, and then consciously separating yourself from it.
