Disappointingly this was not the TRIUMPHANT READING WEEK I had planned, but I'm happy that I stepped back a bit and decided to focus my time on more pressing things - that's personal progress ladies and gents.

I read a total of 526 pages, completing 2 books and 2 challenges:

- Read about a character that is very different from you (Orlando)
- Read a book with a person on the cover / Read a book you bought because of the cover (The Virgin Suicides - I have a copy that I bought for the cover (the one I read) and one with a person on the cover, but I guess that only counts as one challenge right I'm sorry mum)
