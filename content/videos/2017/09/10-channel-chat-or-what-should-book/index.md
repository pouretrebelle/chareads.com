Very interested to hear your opinions on thisâ€¦

Thanks for all the responses so far! I think there may be a bit of self-selection bias but what are ya gonna do. I'm going to mix up the formula a bit by doing some videos solely on one topic related to a book and some with my more traditional review structure. Plus more spoiler warnings before sections :)
