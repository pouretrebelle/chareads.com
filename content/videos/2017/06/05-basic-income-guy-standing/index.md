Spoiler: political discourse

I feel like I'm going to be lynched for being a Tory bc irl I'm surrounded by very angry Labour supporters who make it seem as if supporting the Conservatives is a capital E Evil. Things aren't that black and white, and I encourage you to be critical of anybody that encourages such a binary viewpoint. I don't agree with all the Conservatives policies, but I think they have a better plan than Labour on how to guide our nation over the next 5 years.
