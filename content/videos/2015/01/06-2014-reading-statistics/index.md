Also known as the day I spent struggling with After Effects.

A few people have asked what I use to keep track of the books I read so [here's an Excel spreadsheet template based off mine](http://bit.ly/readingtemplate)

3 days after posting this I realised it was a lie. I re-read The Hobbit. Of course.

## Some other statistics:

- The top 5 longest book I _read_ I actually just listened to the audiobook of
- The shortest book was [The Time Machine](/books/the-time-machine-h-g-wells) at 99 pages
- The only book to receive a perfect 10/10 rating from me was [The Secret History by Donna Tartt](/books/the-secret-history-donna-tartt)
- My lowest-rated book was [The Inner Life by Thomas Ã  Kempis](/books/the-inner-life-thomas-a-kempis), which received a v poor 2/10
- I read the most red-spined books, then black, then white
- My most intense reading stints were in April, where I read 5 books in 4 days, and 4 books in 3 days a week later
- The oldest book I read was [On the Shortness of Life by Seneca](/books/on-the-shortness-of-life-seneca), which was published in 49AD, not before Christ :(
- The last book I read of the year was [The Handmaid's Tale](/books/the-handmaids-tale-margaret-atwood), I was the only person to have actually read it by our book club meetings, so will do a discussion video on that another time
