Lots of pretty books this month. I'm going to be making 80 second reviews for all the Penguin Little Black Classics I buy. Because there are 80 of them. This is has also got me thinking that the length of book videos in seconds should be roughly the number of pages in a book. Interesting rule of thumb.
