This is going to be a rambly essay-length description, go get some tea before you start. I was watching a video by Raeleen (padfootandprongs07) about book buying and guilt - <a href="http://youtu.be/W8fyhNSWMZo">http://youtu.be/W8fyhNSWMZo</a> - which you should totally watch because it's great, and I started to feel quite guilty about this video. I buy a lot of books that I do want to read, but often it's a 'some day' and not a 'right now' thing, and that sucks. Then they're just there growing dust, and that sucks.
