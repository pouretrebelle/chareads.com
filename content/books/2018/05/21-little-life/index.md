summary: |
  When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their centre of gravity. Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome — but that will define his life forever.

My life was on pause while I read this book. Astonishing; sometimes heart-warming, overwhelmingly heart-breaking. [Maxwell's review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1197061477) of "I can't, with a clear conscience, give this book anything less than 5 stars" rang truer with every page turn because I kind of hate this book and never want to see it again, but it's also the most wonderful novel I've ever laid eyes on.
