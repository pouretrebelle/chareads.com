summary: |
  When Derek Sivers started CD Baby, he wasn't planning on building a major business. In 1998 he was a successful independent musician who just wanted to sell his CDs online. Ten years later, he sold CD Baby for $22 million. Sivers didn't need a business plan, and neither do you. You don't need to think big; in fact, it's better if you don't. Anything You Want will inspire you to start with what you have, care about your customers more than yourself, and run your business like you don't need the money.
