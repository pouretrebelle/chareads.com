summary: |
  Kathy is a writer. Kathy is getting married. It’s the summer of 2017, and the whole world is falling apart. From a Tuscan hotel for the super-rich to a Brexit-paralysed UK, Kathy spends the first summer of her 40s trying to adjust to making a lifelong commitment just as Trump is tweeting the world into nuclear war. But it’s not only Kathy who’s changing. Political, social and natural landscapes are all in peril. Fascism is on the rise, truth is dead, the planet is hotting up. Is it really worth learning to love when the end of the world is nigh? And how do you make art, let alone a life, when one rogue tweet could end it all?

Crudo is written _by_ and about Kathy, a 40 year old woman getting married in the summer of 2017. Kathy's life isn't particularly extraordinary or interesting, but the style of writing gave her a dramatic, erratic aura that grated on me (as it was meant to?).

I felt pretty called out by the snippet "she liked hysterics but also stoics", but other than that felt little to no attachment to the character. However, I did think about myself a lot while reading this, how I think differently to her and would make different decisions, and finished the book with a profound awareness of my own autonomy - a terrific feeling, hard to come by when reading in someone else's world.
