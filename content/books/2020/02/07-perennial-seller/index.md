How has it taken me so long to read this? [Ryan Holiday’s ‘The Obstacle Is The Way’](/books/the-obstacle-is-the-way-ryan-holiday) has become my bible on how to approach life. I didn’t think he’d be able to produce another book that so shook me to my core, but wow. He teeters on being contradictory every now and then, but overall this was extremely inspiring with lots of practical advice.
