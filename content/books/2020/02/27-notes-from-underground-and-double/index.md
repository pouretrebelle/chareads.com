summary: |
  Alienated from society and paralysed by a sense of his own insignificance, the anonymous narrator of Dostoyevsky's ground-breaking Notes from Underground tells the story of his tortured life. With bitter irony, he describes his refusal to become a worker in the 'anthill' of society and his gradual withdrawal to an existence 'underground'.
