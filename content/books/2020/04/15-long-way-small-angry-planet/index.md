The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet opens with an introduction to Rosemary Harper, the newest recruit to the long-haul tunnelling ship The Wayfarer, **_but Rosemary is running from her past, will she be able to keep her identity from the rest of her crew, and leave her family's war-mongering legacy behind?_**

Nope, this book isn't about Rosemary at all, she's barely a main character, and when her secret is revealed nobody really cares. Nor is it about the epic wars between fighting galactic species, nor the geo-politics of a new alliance to a secluded but fuel-rich clan.

It's chiefly about camaraderie and friendship, and accepting peoples' differences. A little twee, but it is a fun ride and unexpectedly heart-warming. I just wish it stopped trying to position itself as if it were about all those other things at the same time.
