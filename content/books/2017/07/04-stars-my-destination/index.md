summary: |
  In this pulse-quickening novel, Alfred Bester imagines a future in which people "jaunte" a thousand miles with a single thought, where the rich barricade themselves in labyrinths and protect themselves with radioactive hit men - and where an inarticulate outcast is the most valuable and dangerous man alive. The Stars My Destination is a classic of technological prophecy and timeless narrative enchantment by an acknowledged master of science fiction.

A polarising sci-fi classic, at least for me. So much fun surrealism and adventure but I feel like it has aged really badly, especially in its treatment of women and the expectation that the powerful corporations of its time would spring eternal.
