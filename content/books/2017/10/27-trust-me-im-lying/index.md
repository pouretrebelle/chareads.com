summary: |
  You've seen it all before. A malicious online rumor costs a company millions. A political sideshow derails the national news cycle and destroys a candidate. Some product or celebrity zooms from total obscurity to viral sensation. What you don't know is that someone is responsible for all this. Usually, someone like me.
  I'm a media manipulator. In a world where blogs control and distort the news, my job is to control blogs â€” as much as any one person can. I'm going to explain exactly how the media "really" works. What you choose to do with this information is up to you.
