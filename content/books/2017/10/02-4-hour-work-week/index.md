  Forget the old concept of retirement and the rest of the deferred-life plan - there is no need to wait and every reason not to, especially in unpredictable economic times. Whether your dream is escaping the rat race, experiencing high-end world travel, earning a monthly five-figure income with zero management, or just living more and working less, this book is the blueprint.

I don't think he put enough focus on actually enjoying or being engaged in the work you do do, but overall this is such an in-depth guide to living the Tim Ferriss life, so many neat tricks and new perspectives to streamline any business effort.
