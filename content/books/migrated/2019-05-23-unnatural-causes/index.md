summary: |
  THE TRUE CRIME BOOK OF THE YEAR 'One of the most fascinating books I have read in a long time. Engrossing, a haunting page-turner. A book I could not put down' The Times, BOOKS OF THE YEAR __________
  Meet the forensic pathologist, Dr Richard Shepherd. He solves the mysteries of unexplained or sudden death.
  He has performed over 23,000 autopsies, including some of the most high-profile cases of recent times; the Hungerford Massacre, the Princess Diana inquiry, and 9/11.
  He has faced serial killers, natural disaster, 'perfect murders' and freak accidents.
  His evidence has put killers behind bars, freed the innocent, and turned open-and-shut cases on their heads.
  Yet all this has come at a huge personal cost.
  Unnatural Causes tells the story of not only the cases and bodies that have haunted him the most, but also how to live a life steeped in death. Thoughtful, revealing, chilling and always unputdownable, if you liked All That Remains, War Doctor and This is Going to Hurt you'll love this. __________
