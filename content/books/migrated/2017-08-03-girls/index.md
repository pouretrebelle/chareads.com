summary: |
  THE WORLDWIDE BESTSELLER
  If you’re lost, they’ll find you… Evie Boyd is fourteen and desperate to be noticed.
  It’s the summer of 1969 and restless, empty days stretch ahead of her. Until she sees them. The girls. Hair long and uncombed, jewelry catching the sun. And at their centre, Suzanne, black-haired and beautiful.
  If not for Suzanne, she might not have gone. But, intoxicated by her and the life she promises, Evie follows the girls back to the decaying ranch where they live.
  Was there a warning? A sign of what was coming? Or did Evie know already that there was no way back?
  ‘A coming-of-age tale like no other … the book of the summer’ Grazia
