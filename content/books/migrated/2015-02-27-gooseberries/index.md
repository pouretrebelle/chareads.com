summary: |
  "Oh, good God," he kept saying with great relish. "Good God…" 
  'Gooseberries' is accompanied here by 'The Kiss' and 'The Two Volodyas' - three exquisite depictions of love and loss in nineteenth-century Russia by Chekhov, the great master of the short story form.

Three touching short stories. The first one - about a meek man experiencing the first stirring of romance - was my favourite. They're all about the human condition, our ability to feel, deceive, ignore… I shall definitely be reading more Chekhov soon.
