summary: |
  This is an alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780099740919
  The Republic of Gilead offers Offred only one function: to breed. If she deviates, she will, like dissenters, be hanged at the wall or sent out to die slowly of radiation sickness. But even a repressive state cannot obliterate desire â€“ neither Offred's nor that of the two men on which her future hangs.
  Brilliantly conceived and executed, this powerful evocation of twenty-first-century America gives full rein to Margaret Atwood's devastating irony, wit and astute perception.

I am sad I've finished this. I was going to film a discussion video with my book club on this this evening but I don't think everyone's finished it yet so will probably have to wait for another day. Would recommend.
