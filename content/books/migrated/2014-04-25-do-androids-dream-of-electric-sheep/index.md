summary: |
  It was January 2021, and Rick Deckard had a license to kill. Somewhere among the hordes of humans out there, lurked several rogue androids. Deckard's assignment--find them and then…"retire" them. Trouble was, the androids all looked exactly like humans, and they didn't want to be found!
