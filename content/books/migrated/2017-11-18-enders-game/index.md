summary: |
  Andrew "Ender" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.

There were elements of this that made me want to devour it, but also many unassailable flaws. Chiefly, I just don't buy the premise. A 6 year old is the only hope to save the world? Sure. OK. I'm going to make a video on this book when I find the time.
