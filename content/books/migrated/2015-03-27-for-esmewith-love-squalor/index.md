summary: |
  A collection of nine exceptional stories from the acclaimed author of The Catcher in the Rye 'This is the squalid, or moving, part of the story, and the scene changes. The people change, too. I'm still around, but from here on in, for reasons I'm not at liberty to disclose, I've disguised myself so cunningly that even the cleverest reader will fail to recognize me.'
  This collection of nine stories includes the first appearance of J. D. Salinger's fictional Glass family, introducing Seymour Glass in the unforgettable 'A Perfect Day for Bananafish'.
  'The most perfectly balanced collection of stories I know' Ann Patchett
