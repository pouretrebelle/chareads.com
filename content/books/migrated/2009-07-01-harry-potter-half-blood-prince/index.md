summary: |
  Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts begins, and it feels like a reassuring place to return to after the strange events of the summer. Disappearances, murder and an ominous chilling mist which swirls through both the Muggle and wizarding worlds are harbingers of more-sinister purpose. Voldemort's army is swelling, and with it the Death Eaters are growing bolder and more deadly. Suspicions are rife, and allegiances questioned, as even the safest havens cease to feel secure -from the Dark wizards. As the storm gathers strength, Harry must face the terrifying truth of his destiny.
