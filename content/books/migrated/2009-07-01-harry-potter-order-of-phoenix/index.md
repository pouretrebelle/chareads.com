summary: |
  Dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed Harry through his half-moon glasses. 'It is time,' he said, 'for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything.
  Harry Potter is due to start his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Unusually for a schoolboy, however, Harry is not enjoying his summer holidays. He is feeling neglected by his friends, and, as ever, the Dursleys are making his life a misery. But Harry has had enough. He is beginning to think he must do something, anything, to change his situation. Then the summer holidays come to an unexpectedly dramatic end, and Harry is thrown back into life at Hogwarts School. What Harry is about to discover at Hogwarts will turn his world upside down…
  This is a stunning tour de force, in which J.K. Rowling weaves together with consummate skill the magical ingredients of humour, suspence and drama which have become her trademark.
