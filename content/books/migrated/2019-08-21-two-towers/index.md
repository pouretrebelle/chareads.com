summary: |
  The second part of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic adventure The Lord of the Rings.
  The Company of the Ring is sundered. Frodo and Sam continue their journey alone down the great River Anduin - alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go.
  Thus continues the classic tale begun in The Fellowship of the Ring, which reaches its awesome climax in The Return of the King.
