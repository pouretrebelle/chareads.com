summary: |
  MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOUR
  "If we burn you burn with us"
  Katniss Everdeen has survived the Hunger Games twice. But she's still not safe. A revolution is unfolding, and everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans -- everyone except Katniss.
  And yet she must play the most vital part in the final battle. Katniss must become their Mockingjay -- the symbol of rebellion -- no matter what the personal cost.
