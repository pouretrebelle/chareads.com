It was okay, I didn't particularly like or dislike any of the characters, the good writing was offset by rather banal subject matter. I found the passages about loneliness and the desire for human contact quite sharp and poignant, but there was a cheap twist ending which spoiled any goodwill the book had aroused in me.
