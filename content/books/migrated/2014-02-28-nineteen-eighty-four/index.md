summary: |
  'For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He began writing in a hurried untidy scrawl:
  theyll shoot me i don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother-
  He sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down the pen. The next moment he started violently. There was a knocking at the door.'
