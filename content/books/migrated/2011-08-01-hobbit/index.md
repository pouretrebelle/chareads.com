summary: |
  This beautifully presented collector's box of JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit is a must for fans of this timeless classic and anyone looking to learn more about the story that started it all. Included in this box is a nicely bound hardback edition of The Hobbit and a collection of eight colour postcards featuring some of Tolkien's own artwork. Tolkien himself makes yet another guest appearance on an exclusive CD which features a recording of Tolkien reading an extract from Bilbo's first encounter with the terrifying Gollum. Lastly, there is a beautifully painted foldout map of Wilderland by John Howe with text by Brian Sibley. Those who are fans of The Hobbit will feel justified in splashing out again for this lovely collector's item, which offers plenty of value and makes for an affordable treat or gift for a fellow Tolkien lover. --Jon Weir
