summary: |
  "It's a good time to be a woman: we have the vote and the Pill, and we haven't been burnt as witches since 1727. However, a few nagging questions do remainâ€¦
  Why are we supposed to get Brazilians? Should we use Botox? Do men secretly hate us? And why does everyone ask you when you're going to have a baby?"
  Part memoir, part rant, Caitlin answers the questions that every modern woman is asking.
