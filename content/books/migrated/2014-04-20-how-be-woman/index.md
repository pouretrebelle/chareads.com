summary: |
  "It's a good time to be a woman: we have the vote and the Pill, and we haven't been burnt as witches since 1727. However, a few nagging questions do remain…
  Why are we supposed to get Brazilians? Should we use Botox? Do men secretly hate us? And why does everyone ask you when you're going to have a baby?"
  Part memoir, part rant, Caitlin answers the questions that every modern woman is asking.
