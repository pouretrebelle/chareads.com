summary: |
  “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” — Marcus Aurelius
  We are stuck, stymied, frustrated. But it needn’t be this way. There is a formula for success that’s been followed by the icons of history—from John D. Rockefeller to Amelia Earhart to Ulysses S. Grant to Steve Jobs—a formula that let them turn obstacles into opportunities. Faced with impossible situations, they found the astounding triumphs we all seek.
  These men and women were not exceptionally brilliant, lucky, or gifted. Their success came from timeless philosophical principles laid down by a Roman emperor who struggled to articulate a method for excellence in any and all situations.
  This book reveals that formula for the first time—and shows us how we can turn our own adversity into advantage.

Update March 2018: I've really loved re-listening to this book, it's made me realise how far I've come since I first read it in terms of choosing to approaching problems stoically. Six months ago I cried a lot from putting myself in risky/stressful situations and felt very helpless, and now I'm still doing those things (lol), but my response to them is unceasing positivity and confidence. I'm actually living the wisdom of this book! It'll be interesting to come back to it in a year or so and check in on my progress.

Original review (October 2017): a) This is really good and if you keep the sentiment present in your mind whenever you face adversity it will be immensely helpful. b) it's just a collection of aphorisms, bastardised stoicism, and 'YOU CAN DO IT' cheer.
