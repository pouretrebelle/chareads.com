summary: |
  'I will go in, out of this dust and heat, out of this dry glitter of vanity, out of these toilsome futilities. I will go and never return.' Two disturbing, mysterious and moving stories from Wells, science-fiction pioneer.

  H. G. Wells (1866-1946).

I prefered 'The Door in the Wall' to 'A Slip under the Microscope' but both were rather lovely; about obligation, regret, and anguish.
