summary: |
  The first part of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic adventure The Lord of the Rings.
  In a sleepy village in the Shire, a young hobbit is entrusted with an immense task. He must make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ruling Ring of Power - the only thing that prevents the Dark Lord's evil dominion.
  Thus begins J.R.R. Tolkien's classic tale, which continues in The Two Towers and The Return of the King.
