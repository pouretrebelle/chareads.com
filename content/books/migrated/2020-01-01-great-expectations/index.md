summary: |
  Great Expectations, Dickens' funny, frightening and tender portrayal of the orphan Pip's journey of self-discovery, is one of his best-loved works. Showing how a young man's life is transformed by a mysterious series of events - an encounter with an escaped prisoner; a visit to a black-hearted old woman and a beautiful girl; a fortune from a secret donor - Dickens' late novel is a masterpiece of psychological and moral truth, and Pip among his greatest creations.

Didn't quite finish it in 2019, but making a strong start to 2020 (incidentally a year for which I have great expectations). I want to make a habit of reading a Dickens around Christmas, there's something festive about old English good fortune and hardship. Miss Havisham is iconic, and I loved Pip's progress through the book. All tied up with a neat little bow.
