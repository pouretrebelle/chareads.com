I was prompted to reread this short story when a comment on the review video I made of it years ago suggested that we're living through this scenario at the present [Coronavirus times]. There are certainly parallels of physical isolation / digital community which are eerily prophetic, but I think this book says so much more, about finding meaning in living and cultural homogeneity and absolutism. This remains the most thought-provoking short story I've ever read.
