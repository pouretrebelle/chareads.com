summary: |
  Teenage Silvie and her parents are living in a hut in Northumberland as an exercise in experimental archaeology. Her father is a difficult man, obsessed with imagining and enacting the harshness of Iron Age life. Haunting Silvie's narrative is the story of a bog girl, a young woman sacrificed by those closest to her, and the landscape both keeps and reveals the secrets of past violence and ritual as the summer builds to its harrowing climax.

Still struggling to figure out how I feel about this book. It felt quite dark and scary at some points (the kind of book that can't get away without being burbled 'harrowing'), but also calm and sobering.
