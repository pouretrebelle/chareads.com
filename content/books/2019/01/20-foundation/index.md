Undoubtedly a hugely inflencial and beloved sci-fi series, but for me this was a pretty dry read. A litany of cunning and pacification (any jot of action was duly pacified) complete with a string of slippery important men, none of which you spent enough time with to actually care about. I liked the scope of the story and grandiosity of this inevitable imperial conflict, but don't think I'll wait the few thousand years to see how things shakes out.
