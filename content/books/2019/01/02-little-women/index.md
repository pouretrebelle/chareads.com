summary: |
  'I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning how to sail my ship.'
  Meg, Jo, Amy and Beth - four "little women" enduring hardships and enjoying adventures in Civil War New England The charming story of the March sisters, Little Women has been adored by generations. Readers have rooted for Laurie in his pursuit of Jo's hand, cried over little Beth's death, and dreamed of travelling through Europe with old Aunt March and Amy. Future writers have found inspiration in Jo's devotion to her writing. In this simple, enthralling tale, both parts of which are included here, Louisa May Alcott has created four of American literature's most beloved women.

'Heartache' was a phenomenal chapter, but I found the majority a little too virtuous and domestic for my liking. Even fiery Jo fell to tepid by the end.
