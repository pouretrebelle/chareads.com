summary: |
  It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think. But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most. Inspiring and revelatory, filled with lively anecdotes and moving stories, Factfulness is an urgent and essential book that will change the way you see the world.

Solid read about global trends through the lens of a framework for critical data analysis and assumption-busting. Peppered with many enlightening and humorous (occasionally grave) stories from his work as a public health researcher - you know when a book about statistics starts with a story about sword swallowing you're off to a good start.

See if you can beat my 9/12 in the quiz ;)
