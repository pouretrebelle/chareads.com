summary: |
  Born into an oppressive colonialist society, Creole heiress Antoinette Cosway meets a young Englishman who is drawn to her innocent sensuality and beauty. After their marriage, disturbing rumours begin to circulate, poisoning her husband against her. Caught between his demands and her own precarious sense of belonging, Antoinette is driven towards madness.
  This is a fully annotated edition of Jean Rhys's late literary masterpiece, which was inspired by Charlotte BrontÃ«'s Jane Eyre, and is set in the lush, beguiling landscape of Jamaica in the 1830s.
