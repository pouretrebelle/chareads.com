summary: |
  Presented in a page-per-day format, this daily resource of Stoic inspiration combines new translations of Seneca, Epictetus, Zeno by Stephen Hanselman with calls to further reflection, and action, by Ryan Holiday. Arranged topically following the same three movements (Perception, Action, Will) that Holiday used in The Obstacle is the Way, this guide features twelve principles for overcoming obstacles and achieving greater satisfaction. Aimed at the high-octane, action-oriented, doers of our wired world, this book is intended to open to them a new daily ritual and a new orientation that will bring balanced action, insight, effectiveness, and serenity.
