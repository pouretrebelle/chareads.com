summary: |
  A strange and charming collection of hilariously absurd poetry, writing, and illustration from one of today's most popular young comediansâ€¦ In Egghead, Bo brings his brand of brainy, emotional comedy to the page in the form of off-kilter poems, thoughts, and more. Teaming up with his long-time friend, artist, and illustrator Chance Bone, Bo takes on everything from death to farts in this weird book that will make you think, laugh and think, "why did I just laugh?"
