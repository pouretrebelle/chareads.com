summary: |
  It was January 2021, and Rick Deckard had a license to kill. Somewhere among the hordes of humans out there, lurked several rogue androids. Deckard's assignment—find them and then…"retire" them. Trouble was, the androids all looked exactly like humans, and they didn't want to be found!
