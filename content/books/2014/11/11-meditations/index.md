summary: |
  A series of spiritual exercises filled with wisdom, practical guidance, and profound understanding of human behavior, Meditations remains one of the greatest works of spiritual and ethical reflection ever written. Marcus’s insights and advice — on everything from living in the world to coping with adversity and interacting with others — have made the Meditations required reading for statesmen and philosophers alike, while generations of ordinary readers have responded to the straightforward intimacy of his style. For anyone who struggles to reconcile the demands of leadership with a concern for personal integrity and spiritual well-being, the Meditations remains as relevant now as it was two thousand years ago.
