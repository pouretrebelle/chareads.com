summary: |
  Working in New York one hot summer, Esther Greenwood is on the brink of her future. Yet she is also on the edge of a darkness that makes her world increasingly unreal. In this vivid and unforgettable novel about the struggles of growing up, Esther's world shines through: the wide-eyed country girls, her crazed men-friends, hot dinner dances and nights in New York, and a slow slide into breakdown. â€”back cover

A beautiful account of descent into madness and accent back from it. I love the writing style - it misses out all the useless connecting prose of getting from one place to another and focuses on what's important. Started a bit slow but was totally engrossed by the end.
